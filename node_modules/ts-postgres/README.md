Non-blocking PostgreSQL client for Node.js written in TypeScript.

### Install

To install the latest version of this library:

```sh
$ npm install ts-postgres@latest
```

### Features

* Fast!
* Supports both binary and text value formats
  * Result data is currently sent in binary format only
* Multiple queries can be sent at once (pipeline)
* Extensible value model
* Hybrid query result object
  * Iterable (synchronous or asynchronous; one row at a time)
  * Promise-based

---

## Usage

The client uses an async/await-based programming model.

```typescript
import { Client } from 'ts-postgres';

async function main() {
    const client = new Client();
    await client.connect();

    const stream = client.query(
        `SELECT 'Hello ' || $1 || '!' AS message`,
        ['world']
    );

    for await (const row of stream) {
        console.log(row.get('message')); // 'Hello world!'
    }

    await client.end();
}

main()
```
The example above uses the variable ``stream`` to indicate that the result set is made available as it arrives on the connection. But we'll often want to just wait for the entire result set to arrive before starting to process the data.

```typescript
const result = await client.query('select generate_series(1, 10)');
```
If the query fails, waiting for the result will throw an exception.

### Iterator interface

Whether we're operating on a stream or an already waited for result set, the iterator interface provides the most high-level row interface. This also applies when using the _spread_ operator:

```typescript
const rows = [...result];
```

Each row provides direct access to values through its ``data`` attribute, but we can also get a value by name using the ``get(name)`` method.

```typescript
for (const row of rows) {
  console.log('The number is: ' + row.get('i')); // 1, 2, 3, ...
}
```
Note that values are polymorphic and need to be explicitly cast to a concrete type such as ``number`` or ``string``.

### Result interface

This interface is available on the already waited for result object. It makes data available in the ``rows`` attribute as an array of arrays (of values).
```typescript
for (const row of result.rows) {
  console.log('The number is: ' + row[0]); // 1, 2, 3, ...
}
```
This is the most efficient way to work with result data. Column names are available as the ``names`` attribute of a result.

### Multiple queries

The query command accepts a single query only. If you need to send multiple queries, just call the method multiple times. For example, to send an update command in a transaction:
```typescript
client.query('begin');
client.query('update ...');
await client.query('commit');
```
The queries are sent back to back over the wire, but PostgreSQL still processes them one at a time, in the order they were sent (first in, first out).

### Prepared statements

You can prepare a query and subsequently execute it multiple times. This is also known as a "prepared statement".
```typescript
const statement = await client.prepare(
    `SELECT 'Hello ' || $1 || '!' AS message`
);
for await (const row of statement.execute(['world'])) {
    console.log(row.get('message')); // 'Hello world!'
}
```
When the prepared statement is no longer needed, it should be closed to release the resource.
```typescript
await statement.close();
```
Prepared statements can be used (executed) multiple times, even concurrently.

## Notes

Queries with parameters are sent using the prepared statement variant of the extended query protocol. In this variant, the type of each parameter is determined prior to parameter binding, ensuring that values are encoded in the correct format.

If a query has no parameters, it uses the portal variant which saves a round trip.

The copy commands are not supported.

## FAQ

1. _How do I set up a pool of connections?_ You can for example use the [generic-pool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generic-pool) library:

   ```typescript
   import { createPool } from 'generic-pool';

   const pool = createPool({
       create: async () => {
           const client = new Client();
           return client.connect().then(() => {
               client.on('error', console.log);
               return client;
           });
       },
       destroy: async (client: Client) => {
           return client.end().then(() => { })
       },
       validate: (client: Client) => {
           return Promise.resolve(!client.closed);
       }
   }, { testOnBorrow: true });

   pool.use(...)
   ```

## Benchmarking

Use the following environment variable to run tests in "benchmark" mode.

```bash
$ NODE_ENV=benchmark npm run test
```
