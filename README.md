Incomplete solution - power went out 
Testing has not been extensive, many errors unchecked (improper input, file not there)
Works with .txt files from the gutenberg digital library
Replace 'filename' with the actual filename and include extention
File must be present in directory
Time spent: 4.5 hours

Usage:
"node trigram.js" this opens interactive commands
then:
"upload filename" to add a file
"files" to print a list of files
"file id= filename" to return info about the file
"generate file= filename maxSize= size seedWords= word1 word2"
"exit" to exit
